        "    No, the \"‼️𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗱‼️\" issue could not be diagnosed or fixed because the bot failed to launch due to an invalid `BOT_TOKEN`.\n",

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `https://github.com/kesav1503/ADVANCE-TXT-UPLOADER` repository was successfully cloned, and its dependencies were installed.\n",
        "*   The initial attempt to run the bot failed with a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` at line 557 in `main.py`, caused by an incorrect assignment operator (`==` instead of `=`) and commented-out conditional logic for the `thumb` variable.\n",
        "*   A robust fix was implemented in `main.py` by programmatically modifying lines 551-556 to uncomment the `thumb` variable's assignment and conditional logic, resolving the `SyntaxError`.\n",
        "*   After the `SyntaxError` fix, the bot consistently failed to launch due to a `pyrogram.errors.exceptions.bad_request_400.AccessTokenInvalid` error, indicating that the provided `BOT_TOKEN` (`8551803950:AAEVdjf6EqsAlg21FEaxjQBJ0DrZsiyBak`) was invalid or expired. This issue persisted even after attempting to re-set the token.\n",
        "*   Due to the invalid `BOT_TOKEN`, the bot never successfully started, preventing any diagnosis or verification of the \"‼️𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗱‼️\" issue for `.txt` files or their video conversion functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The immediate next step is to obtain and use a valid `BOT_TOKEN` to allow the bot to authenticate and run successfully.\n",
        "*   Once the bot is operational, the \"‼️𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗱‼️\" issue for `.txt` files can be diagnosed and resolved, followed by verification of the `.txt` to video conversion feature.\n"
